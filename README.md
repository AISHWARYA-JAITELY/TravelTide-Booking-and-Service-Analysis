# TravelTide-Booking-and-Service-Analysis
In this SQL project for TravelTide, I analyzed flight departures on weekdays vs. weekends, identified users with top hotel discounts, and evaluated airport service frequencies. I ranked airports by service count to optimize travel schedules, enhance customer discounts, and improve airport operations. The data was derived from Travel Tide, which is an online booking platform for travel, specializing in discount airplane tickets and hotel accommodations.
