# TravelTide-Booking-and-Service-Analysis
In this SQL project for TravelTide, I analyzed flight departures on weekdays vs. weekends, identified users with top hotel discounts, and evaluated airport service frequencies. I ranked airports by service count to optimize travel schedules, enhance customer discounts, and improve airport operations.
